CLOJURE RELOADER

Monitors a directory and loads a clojure file. If a .clj file is monitored in that directory
the process is shutdown and then reloaded.

Helpful in server related projects where the server needs to constantly be restarted during development.

Inspired by django's autoreloading development server
http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/tags/releases/1.0/django/utils/autoreload.py

Example useage:
java -cp $CLASSPATH clojure.main autoreload.clj example.clj

edit the print statement in example.clj save the file and autoreload will restart the process.
(Note: $CLASSPATH should contain the clojure jar of course. Replace with %CLASSPATH% on windows)

It picks the first .clj file in *command-line-args* as the file to load, so if you're having trouble getting this to run make sure your script that loads clojure doesn't included 'autoreload.clj' in *command-line-args*.
